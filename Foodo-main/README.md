Foodo is a website I created during a group project for the Databases and Web Services course.
It is a recipe finder with many different types of filters. The user can search for recipes based on ingredients, cuisine and more. The website is also linked to a database and provides user interface to be able to insert into the backend through the website.

In this project, I was mainly responsible for handling the connection with the database, using mainly PHP PDO and MySQL, with the occasional HTML and JS.

The website can also be found at: http://clabsql.clamv.jacobs-university.de/~asavu/
Note: this an only can be accessed through VPN or at Jacobs University Bremen.
