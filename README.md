# FooDoo

I developed the website Foodo as part of a group assignment for the Databases and Web Services course. It is a recipe finder with a wide range of filter options. Recipes can be searched for using many criteria, including ingredients and cuisine. Additionally connected to a database, the website offers a user interface that enables users to insert data directly into the backend.
